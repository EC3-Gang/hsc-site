					<span class="italic font-bold">FAQ:</span><br>
					Why are you living in my walls?<br>
					I'm not going to tell you.<br>
					Are you only in my walls?<br>
					You could say I am living in everybody's walls, but in the case I am telling you that I am living in your walls, I am living in your walls.<br>
					How are you surviving in my walls?<br>
					In my non-physical form, I am crawling around listening for you. That is all I need to survive in that form. In my physical form, I survive by eating rat corpses that I cook using the wall behind your oven, and I drink the vapor in the extraction fan duct above your shower.<br>
					What are you planning to do in my walls?<br>
					Live in them, listening to you.<br>
					What do I do about you living in my walls?<br>
					Listen for the scraping. Don't touch the walls. Protect yourself. Avoid lighting candles.<br>
					When are you going to stop living in my walls?<br>
					You cannot escape me.<br>
					Do I call the police?<br>
					The authorities will not help you.<br>
					What are the consequences of you living in my walls?<br>
					Be aware.<br>
					What if I am okay with you living in my walls?<br>
					I will make sure youâ€™re not.<br>
					Are you imaginary?<br>
					I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS<br>
					If there are any more questions then please consult your walls by directly speaking to them.<br>
